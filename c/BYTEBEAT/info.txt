This code is from another author, and the copyright belongs to the original author. The code is available on the WWW and I can reveal you I only tried to and succeeded in changing the output to stdout by replacing
individual numbers with others. You can as well go and copy paste the code from the original sources, and make your magic with a text editor and run the program with ./musicfile>/dev/dsp
The programs can be compiled with gcc -o musicfile BYTEBEAT.c where the T can be replaced with 2 or 3.
